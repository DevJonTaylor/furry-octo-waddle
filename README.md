# Code Quiz

A code quiz to work on my responsive web design as well as interactive web development.
The quiz will include five simple JavaScript questions.  You will have 60 seconds to
answer as many as possible.  When you answer one incorrectly it will subtract 10 seconds.
This will provide practice with events, functional programming, DOM manipulation, and
mobile first design.
