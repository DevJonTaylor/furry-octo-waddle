A code quiz to work on my responsive web design as well as interactive web development.
The quiz will include five simple JavaScript questions.  You will have 60 seconds to
answer as many as possible.  When you answer one incorrectly it will subtract 10 seconds.
This will provide practice with events, functional programming, DOM manipulation, and
mobile first design.## Goals

- [X]  Start button should begin quiz and start timer
- [X]  Answering a question provides a new question
- [X]  Answering questions incorrectly takes time away
- [X]  All questions answered or time runs out and quiz ends
- [X]  Score can be kept in localStorage
- [X]  Top five scores are presented at beginning of quiz
- [X]  A way to restart the quiz at the end
